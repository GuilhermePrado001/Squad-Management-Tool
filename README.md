# Getting Started with Squad Management Tool

## Script

Run "npm install" on branch "master" to install all dependencies.

Now it is necessary to start the application by running the command "npm start" the application must go up at "http://localhost:3000"

If you need the site can be seen at the following link [GitPage](https://guilhermeprado001.github.io/) but on github pages an "f5" within a route eg:/edit/0 does not work.
